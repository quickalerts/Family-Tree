# Family-Tree
This Project displays an interactive family tree chart. It retrieves family member data from a MySQL database, processes the relationships between members, and uses D3.js and a custom family chart library to visualize the data in an HTML page. The page includes navigation links and stylesheets for a complete user experience.
